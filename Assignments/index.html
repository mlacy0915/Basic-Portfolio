    <p>Texas born and raised. I have lived in and
        around Dallas most of my life. I would describe me
        as... There is no set discription for me! I am quite but 
        loud. Shy but ougoing, the scariest dare devil ever, I love 
        going out with my friends, but at the same time I'm 
        addicted to my bed and playing the sims. Im am ever changing
        and growing determind to be the best me I can be. I live for 
        new experiences and love life.</p>
